	<ul>
		<li id="build"><a href="#build">[0:00]</a>
			<p>Always build walls and ramps for protection and mobility.</p>
			<p>When under fire, try to build quickly to create cover.</p>
			<p>Use ramps to gain height advantage and take shots at your opponents.</p>
		</li>
		<li id="land"><a href="#land">[1:23]</a>
			<p>Try to land in a less populated area to loot up and avoid early game fights.</p>
			<p>Check the map and look for areas with few named locations.</p>
			<p>Once you have enough weapons and materials, you can move to more populated areas.</p>
		</li>
		<li id="storm"><a href="#storm">[3:15]</a>
			<p>Keep an eye on the storm and plan your rotations accordingly.</p>
			<p>Check the map regularly to see where the storm is moving and plan your route accordingly.</p>
			<p>Try to avoid getting caught in the storm as it can quickly drain your health.</p>
		</li>
		<li id="sound"><a href="#sound">[5:02]</a>
			<p>Use headphones to listen for footsteps and gunshots.</p>
			<p>Pay attention to the direction of the sounds to help locate opponents.</p>
			<p>Be aware that some opponents may be using silenced weapons, which can be harder to hear.</p>
		</li>
		<li id="loadout"><a href="#loadout">[7:09]</a>
			<p>Experiment with different weapon combinations to find your preferred loadout.</p>
			<p>Consider carrying a mix of weapons for different ranges and situations.</p>
			<p>Be sure to keep an eye on your ammo and swap out weapons as needed.</p>
